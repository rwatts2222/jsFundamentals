/*

    - falsy values: a value that is considered false when encountered in a Boolean context (Boolean's are a data type that can only be true or false)

    - there are six cases of falsy values in JavaScript:
        1. false
        2. 0
        3. "", '', ``
        4. null
        5. undefined
        6. NaN (not a number)

    - This means that when JavaScript is expecting a boolean and is given one of these values, it will always evaluate to "falsy"
